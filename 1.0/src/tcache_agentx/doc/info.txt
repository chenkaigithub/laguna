Status of the control plane (i.e. is it running, does it have some sort of error condition)

 

Amount of traffic monitored in last 24 hours, hour, minute

 

Number of interceptions (i.e. redirects) performed in last 24 hours, hour, minute

Tally of top domains (e.g. Youtube, Netflix, Apple) seen in last 24 hours, hour, minute

 

Tally of top domains intercepted in last 24 hours, hour, minute

 

Tally of top video formats seen in last 24 hours, hour, minute
