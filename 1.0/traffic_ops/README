The LAGUNA.traffic_ops profile adds the default configuration data for
a Laguna server to pull from the traffic-control-cdn project.

Steps to upload:
1.  Login to Traffic Ops
2.  Navigate to the misc/profiles page
3.  Click the 'Import Profile' button
4.  Select the LAGUNA.traffic_ops file
5.  Click 'Submit'

Traffic Ops will churn for a bit as the profile is ingested

After the upload is complete you will see the Laguna profile in the
list of profiles.

Parameters names in the Laguna profile include indexes to facilitate
ease when conversion/creation of the Laguna configuration files, which are
YAML or JSON formatted.  If modifying, pay CLOSE attention to the
indexes so that they are unique and consistent.  Gaps in numbering
will be taken care of by the configuration retrieval mechanism.

Unlike the rest of Traffic Ops, Laguna uses Posix regular expression
formats, not PCRE.
