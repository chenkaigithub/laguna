; This is where you run individual Tornado instances.
; We run four; one per processor core.
; In development, we ran as many as four per core with no issues.
; If you're looking to minimize cpu load, run fewer processes.
; BTW, Tornado processes are single threaded.
; To take advantage of multiple cores, you'll need multiple processes.
